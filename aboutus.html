<b><font size=6>About us</font></b><p>
we are Ofer Levinger (mechanical engineer) and Jonathan Nathan (physicist). Our interest in 3d printers started out as a challenge - to build a 3d printer from scratch. After building two different printers, we discovered OpenSCAD - a programming language that allows creation of 3d designs.
<p>
Both of us immediately connected with the programmatic approach to 3d design, and enjoyed very much creating templates for our own use. At a certain point, we decided to share these templates with the 3d printing community (for free!) in this site. We use a free wonderful library called <a href="http://openjscad.org/">OpenJSCAD</a> (OpenSCAD for javascript) to render and calculate our templates in the browser.<p>
This site includes some features never-seen-before in the 3d printing community such as:<br>
<ul>
<li>Various text templates featuring a large variety of fonts in different languages. The templates currently support English, Arabic(!) and Hebrew(!!).</li>
<li>Different types of transmissions, including Beveled Gears!</li>
<li>Free usage, no questions asked, download STL files suitable for printing on your own printer or with a commercial printing service.</li>

</ul>
In addition to writing parametric templates for 3d printed objects, we both work also on several alternative education research projects with high-school students.
